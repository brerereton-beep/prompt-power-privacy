Privacy policy for the Prompt Power Chrome extension
Privacy Policy for Prompt Power

Prompt Power is a browser extension designed to help users transform rough ideas into clear, camera-aware, cinematic prompts.

Data Collection

Prompt Power does not collect, track, or sell personal user data.

The extension processes text entered by the user solely to generate improved prompts. This text is sent directly to the OpenAI API using an API key provided by the user.

API Keys

Users may optionally store their own OpenAI API key locally in their browser using Chrome’s local storage. This key is stored only on the user’s device and is never transmitted to the developer or any third party other than OpenAI.

Data Storage

Prompt Power does not store user data on external servers. Any locally stored data (such as an API key) remains on the user’s device and can be removed at any time.

Third-Party Services

Prompt Power communicates with OpenAI’s API to generate improved prompts. Use of the OpenAI API is governed by OpenAI’s own privacy policy and terms of service.

Data Usage

User data is used exclusively for the core functionality of the extension and is not used for analytics, advertising, or tracking.
